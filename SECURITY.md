## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please submit a vulnerability report at huntr.dev if you find a vulnerability in this project. They have a nice system where anyone can submit a report to any open-source GitHub project and if it is a valid vuln you can get paid up to $250 depending on the severity.

They will then contact me to look at the vuln.

You can also email me directly at cyberqueenmeg@wearehackerone.com (forwards to my main email) and I will get back to you as soon as I can!
